<p><span class="smcap">My Lords and Gentlemen</span>,</p>
<p>As Certain statements have appeared in the Local Journals
reflecting upon my character as the Honorary Conductor of
&ldquo;The Readings,&rdquo; and upon the Institution, I deem it
my duty to send this statement to you, with the request that you
will give it your kind and impartial consideration.&nbsp; I
should not have adopted this course had the Editors of those
journals, viz.: &ldquo;The Marylebone Mercury&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Bayswater Chronicle,&rdquo; inserted my letters
addressed to them, giving a denial of the
misrepresentations.&nbsp; I think it may not be out of place to
give you a sketch of the progress of the Institution, and to
mention from what cause I was induced to commence the series of
Penny Readings first known as &ldquo;Praed Street Penny
Readings,&rdquo; but afterwards more appropriately termed
&ldquo;The Marylebone Penny Readings.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had attended
many Penny Reading meetings within the metropolis and was
thoroughly convinced that such meetings were not only <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>calculated to
do much good, but would be very acceptable to the working classes
if properly conducted; but, unfortunately, in many instances the
programmes abounded with Vulgar Comic Songs, while in others a
religious spirit was infused, rendering the programme monotonous
and unattractive.&nbsp; Having a little time at my disposal, I
determined upon founding a series of Penny Readings, having for
its objects&mdash;&ldquo;presenting a counter attraction to
haunts of vice and of creating and improving the tastes for pure
and standard literature.&rdquo;&nbsp; With this view, I gave an
inaugural meeting at the Foresters&rsquo; Hall, on Thursday
evening, November 21st, 1867, when our esteemed member, Mr.
Thomas Chambers, M.P., Q.C., presided; through the kindness of
the Rev. John Clifford, LL.B., I was permitted to hold a series
of twenty-seven meetings in the small room beneath &ldquo;Praed
Street Chapel;&rdquo; the first meeting was held there on the
24th November, under the Presidency of Mr. F. Berridge,
F.R.G.S.&nbsp; The first four meetings were thinly attended, but
the attendance gradually increased until they acquired a
popularity as the first of their class.</p>
<p>Encouraged by success, another branch was opened at &ldquo;The
Lecture Hall, New Church Street.&rdquo;&nbsp; This branch,
unfortunately, proved a financial failure.&nbsp; At the end of
the series I found we were in debt to the extent of &pound;25: of
this I paid &pound;15, and with the consent of the creditors,
about &pound;10 was allowed to remain until another season; under
these circumstances I did not feel justified in increasing our
liabilities by publishing a report.&nbsp; Being now practically
convinced that although these meetings could not be a financial
success, they would accomplish their object and be very
acceptable to the working classes&mdash;knowing that there were
many noblemen <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>and gentlemen who would willingly assist such a good and
really charitable cause, I appealed to many I knew to be
interested in the welfare and progress of the working man, and
had the pleasure of receiving many affirmative and encouraging
replies.&nbsp; In November last I wrote to the Rev. J. Moorhouse,
(Vicar of St. James&rsquo;s, Paddington), for permission to hold
meetings within the St. James&rsquo;s National
Schools,&mdash;this was granted for a period of thirteen
meetings; the series were duly inaugurated at the Schools, and
well attended.&nbsp; After the seventh Reading, I received an
intimation from the Secretary of the School Committee to the
effect that they had resolved to withdraw their permission on the
ground that such Readings were not in conformation with the
objects for which the Schools were built, viz.: National
Education.&nbsp; I must confess I was greatly surprised at this
declaration, inasmuch as many gentlemen of eminence who had
presided at the meetings, including the Rt. Hon. A. H. Layard,
M.P., and Thomas Chambers, Esq., M.P., had publicly stated that
they believed such meetings to be a certain and valuable channel
for the conveyance of learning.&nbsp; Such being the decision of
the School Committee, however unjustified they may have been in
withdrawing the permission before the expiration of the stated
time, I had no alternative but to submit to that decision.&nbsp;
I then engaged the large and commodious Hall known as
&ldquo;Providence Hall,&rdquo; and this was presided over by our
esteemed patron the Hon. Lord Fitzmaurice, M.P., for Calne.&nbsp;
We were again successful until a clique was formed against us by
members of a similar institution and others to disturb our
meetings.&nbsp; After vainly attempting to hold meetings, I
called a private meeting, at which Mr. Edmond Beales presided,
and we decided upon holding <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>no further meetings for the present;
at the same time a committee was formed at my request to audit
and investigate accounts, and to publish the report.</p>
<p>Having given you a brief, and I trust a satisfactory account
of our proceedings, I feel it incumbent upon me to comment upon
the statements referred to in the former part of this
address.&nbsp; The first subject of comment will be the circular
<i>purporting</i> to be issued by Lord Lichfield; the second, the
case of Oetzmann <i>versus</i> The Marylebone Penny Readings; and
thirdly, the scandalous and unfounded reports of the Local
Journals.</p>
<p>The circular referred to was that issued by Mr. C. J. Ribton
Turner (?), and purporting to be signed by Lichfield, Hodgson
Pratt, J. W. Probyn, H. N. Hoare, Auberon Herbert, and Julian
Goldsmid, who state that they have withdrawn their names from the
Patron List of &ldquo;The Marylebone Penny Readings&rdquo; owing
to reports which have appeared in &ldquo;The Marylebone
Mercury&rdquo; of proceedings taken against the Hon. Conductor in
the Bloomsbury County Court; and that &ldquo;we beg further to
state that though Mr. Taylor was requested by Lord Lichfield on
the 3rd inst., (March), to furnish a statement of his receipts
and expenditure, he has not, up to the present time, thought fit
to comply with the invitation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether in issuing
this circular Mr. C. J. Ribton Turner has been authorised to use
the names appended to it, I cannot say; but this I can truly
affirm,&mdash;that the said circular is a tissue of
misrepresentations.&nbsp; In the first place, I was <i>never</i>
requested by Lord Lichfield to furnish any account
whatever.&nbsp; The facts of the case are these:&mdash;On
Tuesday, March 1st., the Right Hon. the Earl of Lichfield (with
authority) was announced to preside at our usual weekly meeting;
his Lordship came to the meeting, (I am informed <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>accompanied by
Thomas Oetzmann and others, this being previously arranged); his
Lordship informed the audience that he had never given his
consent to preside at the meeting, and expressed his
dissatisfaction at the course Mr. Taylor had taken regarding the
payment of the account of Thomas Oetzmann, trading as Thomas
Oetzmann &amp; Company (?).&nbsp; With all due respect to his
Lordship, I am assured that he gave his consent to preside; and
it may be desirable to mention, that on the Thursday previous to
the meeting, I sent a note reminding him of his promise; and on
the following Monday I sent a programme of the meeting.&nbsp; If
his Lordship had not promised to preside, why did he not send an
intimation?&nbsp; On the 2nd March I addressed a letter to his
Lordship apologizing for the mistake, <i>if</i> on our part, and
asking whether I should retain his Lordship on the Patron List,
and adding that I should be pleased to furnish him with a
statement of receipts and expenditure.&nbsp; I trusted that his
Lordship would not be guided by <i>exparte</i> statements.&nbsp;
On the 4th his Lordship replied, stating that he must decline to
remain on the Patron List, but would be willing to give any
statement that might be forwarded his impartial
consideration.&nbsp; I was prevented by ill health from sending
the account before the 20th.&nbsp; On the 23rd his Lordship
returned the account for audit and publication, and it is now in
the hands of the Audit Committee.&nbsp; As I had the authority to
place the names of Hodgson Pratt, Julian Goldsmid, H. N. Hoare,
and J. W. Probyn, Esquires, upon the List of Patrons, in the
absence of any notification that either of those gentlemen wished
to have their names removed, I may with justice consider them as
belonging to the Institution.&nbsp; A note is appended to the
effect that the Rev. James Moorhouse <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>and Dr. Forbes Winslow never
authorized the publication of their names as Patrons; this I beg
to state is false, and that those gentlemen have taken very
prominent parts in our meetings; from these facts I consider that
we may very justly ignore the circular and its fallacious
contents.</p>
<p>The next subject for comment is the case of Oetzmann
<i>versus</i> The Marylebone Penny Readings, in which I was, as
Hon. Conductor, sued for the balance of accounts.&nbsp; I think
it necessary to state that the original amount of account was
&pound;3 17s. 1d.; of this &pound;2 1s. was paid, leaving a
balance of &pound;1 16s.&nbsp; For this balance I was sued!&nbsp;
A representative of the firm (collector I presume) called upon me
at the latter-end of December for the amount.&nbsp; I told him we
were not in a position to pay, but would guarantee its payment
within three months; the collector expressed his approbation, and
withdrew.&nbsp; On me 22nd January I received a copy of
&ldquo;The Marylebone Mercury;&rdquo; upon perusal I found, to my
great surprise, a report of the case in which I was sued for the
balance of account at the suit of &ldquo;Thomas Oetzmann, trading
as Thomas Oetzmann and Company.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did not receive
any summons, nor was I aware that proceedings were taken until I
saw the paper alluded to.&nbsp; In support of the case, letters
were put in, in one of which it was stated I pleaded
minority,&mdash;this I most emphatically deny! and in support of
this assertion, beg to state that I called upon the said Thomas
Oetzmann on the 16th of March to produce the said letter, which
of course was not done.&nbsp; Comment is needless.&nbsp; The
account is paid; but nevertheless, Thomas Oetzmann continues a
system of unjustifiable persecution, at once unmanly and
cowardly; he has been to our tradesmen and made gross
misrepresentations; he has been to our Halls and disturbed our
meetings, <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>and guilty of such conduct as any honest man would be
ashamed of.</p>
<p>Now I would refer to the unwarrantable attacks made upon me,
and &ldquo;the readings&rdquo; in the columns of &ldquo;The
Marylebone Mercury&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Bayswater
Chronicle.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am an ardent advocate for the liberty
of the press; but I think all will agree with me that as the
press have undoubted power, they should be careful how that power
is used in giving currency to personal attacks and <i>exparte</i>
statements; when this is done, they should at least give the
attacked party an opportunity of replying to the
accusations;&mdash;this has not been done in my case.&nbsp; My
letters addressed to the Editors of both journals, containing
denials to unfounded statements and inaccurate reports, have been
suppressed in many cases; while in others disjointed and useless
extracts have been made from them.&nbsp; I would appeal to you,
is this justice?&nbsp; You will, I am sure, say
&ldquo;No!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Marylebone Mercury&rdquo; has
been extremely bitter and unjust in its criticism.&nbsp; I think
it a disgrace that any journal having the Flag of Freedom hanging
over its head, should insert petty, and of course anonymous
attacks at the instance of any one who advertises largely in
their columns; but in the Mercury, (or more appropriately
speaking, &ldquo;M&uacute;ckery&rdquo;), Editorial Office Justice
is most decidedly blind.&nbsp; As to &ldquo;The Bayswater
Chronicle,&rdquo; Bacchus and prejudice seem to be the presiding
Gods&mdash;it has been of late a repertoire of unwarrantable
attacks and false reports, such as it is plainly perceptible
emanate from a malicious pen.&nbsp; It may not be out of the
place to state that the Editor of &ldquo;The Bayswater
Chronicle&rdquo;&mdash;a Mr. Myers (?)&mdash;came to our meeting
one evening in a state of intoxication, having, as his friend
informed us, been tasting wine at the Docks.&nbsp; After vainly
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>endeavouring to disturb the meeting, the gentleman (?)
conducted himself in a most abominable and disgusting
manner&mdash;so much so, that appeals were made to me from all
parts of the Hall to expel him; but being unwilling to do so, I
allowed him to remain; however, the audience violently expelled
him by sundry kicks and a good bonnetting; this may be sufficient
to account for the bitter spirit in which &ldquo;Mr.
Editor&rdquo; discharges that which he has the audacity to term a
public duty.</p>
<p>Comparisons have been drawn between the meetings of our
Institution, and those of a similar character, which it is
asserted not only pay their own expenses, but yield a surplus for
charity; but it must be borne in mind that our meetings are very
superior to any of the same class, and that we have to pay for
the hire of halls, for hirage of pianos, and occasionally for
artistes, while the majority of other Readings have their rooms
and pianos lent to them; these items, though not very great,
materially increase the expenditure; but for all this, I feel
justified in stating that had it not have been for the malicious
intervention of &ldquo;the clique,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
Readings&rdquo; would have been almost self-supporting.</p>
<p>I trust I may not be thought egotistical in the few remarks I
am compelled to make concerning myself, as you are aware there is
much labour attached to the post which I hold.&nbsp; I have
laboured unceasingly, and I trust successfully, to establish a
Penny Reading Institution after the design of its
originators,&mdash;Mr. Sergeant Cox and Professor
Plumptre;&mdash;but this labour has had the effect of greatly
injuring my health,&mdash;of preventing the application of my
energies to a lucrative undertaking.&nbsp; I do not complain, for
my task has been a labour of love to me, but am naturally grieved
to find that, after <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>having devoted so much valuable time and hard-earned
cash, I should meet with such unwarrantable and unjustifiable
attacks and absurd opposition.&nbsp; I cannot but accept this as
a good omen, for every good movement meets with great
opposition.&nbsp; This I think proves the truth of that great
Shakesperian quotation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let Hercules do what ere he may,<br />
Cats will mew, and every dog will have his day!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even that horrid dog opposition.&nbsp; I have much pleasure in
stating that the affairs of the Institution will in future be
managed by a President, Chairman, Treasurer, Auditors,
Secretaries, and a council elected of Noblemen and Gentlemen,
selected from the List of Patrons and Artistes.&nbsp; A
subscription list is opened for the purpose of liquidating the
debts of the Institution.&nbsp; Those who desire to testify their
appreciation of our labours, will kindly send their subscriptions
to our esteemed friend Edmond Beales, Esq., 4, <i>Stone
Buildings</i>, <i>Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn</i>, <i>W.C.</i>, who has
kindly consented to receive subscriptions, and to see that they
are applied to the liquidation of our debts.&nbsp; I cannot
conclude without returning my sincere thanks to Earl Spencer; the
Hon. Lord Arthur Clinton; Thomas Chambers, Esq., M.P.; Edmond
Beales, Esq.; the Hon. Auberon Herbert; the Rev. J. Clifford; the
Rev. Jas. Moorhouse; Mr. Sergeant Cox; Professor Plumptre;
Frederick Berridge, Esq.; H. W. Oatway, Esq.; Dr. J. E.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
